    /* Implementation note: We create moves by means of static "factory
     * methods" all named create, which in turn use the single (private)
     * constructor.  Factory methods have certain advantages over constructors:
     * they allow you to produce results having an arbitrary subtype of Move,
     * and they don't require that you produce a new object each time.  This
     * second advantage is useful when you are trying to speed up the creation
     * of Moves for use in automated searching for moves.  You can (if you
     * want) create just one instance of the Move representing 1-5, for example
     * and return it whenever that move is requested. */
